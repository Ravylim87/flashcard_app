# Development Environment

The tools that were used for developing a fake card for this project are Android Studio ,it is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development. It is the most popular choice for developing Android apps and provides a comprehensive set of tools for building, testing, and debugging Android apps.


The Flashcard app is developed using the Kotlin programming language. Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can also be compiled to JavaScript or native code. 

The Flashcard app also uses several libraries, including:
